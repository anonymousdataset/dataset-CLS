{"label": "CORRECT", "text": "A man racially abused an 81-year-old pensioner as he walked to a mosque before launching a fatal drink and drug-fuelled attack with his friend, a court has heard. Dale Jones flew into a 'raging fury' following a day and evening of drinking and taking drugs and accused Mushin Ahmed of being a 'groomer', Sheffield Crown Court heard. Jones and Damien Hunt punched, kicked and stamped on Mr Ahmed as he made his way to prayers at the mosque in Rotherham, the jury was told. Andrew Robertson QC, prosecuting, said: 'Since his retirement (Mr Ahmed) had been a regular attender at the mosque. 'In the early hours of Monday August 10 last year, he set off to the mosque for prayers. He never made it to the mosque. On his way there, just after 3am, he was attacked and murdered.' Mr Robertson said Jones had become agitated, violent and aggressive due to an issue concerning his partner's son's father. He had left the home he shared with his partner in Rotherham at 10am the previous morning and spent the day and night drinking Sambuca and Southern Comfort, and taking cocaine and diazepam, the court heard. Mr Robertson said: 'He had got himself into a raging fury. A rage fuelled by drugs and alcohol.' A short time before the fatal attack, Jones racially abused an Asian taxi driver, the jury was told. Mr Robertson said: 'There was an incident of blatant aggression by Jones that demonstrated his racist attitude. A taxi driver came down Doncaster Road. The driver was Asian. Jones began shouting racial abuse.' Around 10 minutes later, Mr Ahmed emerged on to Doncaster Road, where Jones was with Hunt and brothers Kieran and Shane Rice. Mr Robertson said: 'Jones immediately accused him of being a groomer. No doubt his word for paedophile and no doubt an accusation made by Jones for no better reason than Mr Ahmed was Asian.' The prosecutor said CCTV footage showed Jones and Hunt following Mr Ahmed. The Rice brothers said they then saw Jones punch and kick Mr Ahmed in the head, the court heard. Mr Robertson said Jones saw a friend around an hour after the attack. When the friend asked how he was, he replied: 'It's a good job you're not a P***.' The barrister said: 'A good indication of what motivated him to attack Mr Ahmed and a good indicator of how he felt about it.' Mr Ahmed was found by a passer-by two hours after the attack and was taken to hospital, where he died 11 days later, on August 21. Mr Robertson said Mr Ahmed suffered extensive head and facial injuries and had the imprint of a trainer across the front of his face. The imprint was believed to match that of the make of trainer worn by Jones on the night, and Hunt's DNA was found on Mr Ahmed's broken dentures, the court heard. Jones, 29, and Hunt, 29, of Rotherham, both deny murder and are expected to blame each other, the court heard. The trial continues.   .", "claim": "81岁的穆辛·艾哈迈德在去清真寺祈祷的路上遭到袭击和谋杀。"}
{"label": "INCORRECT", "text": "A Florida nurse is suing Cesar Millan after she was viciously attacked by a pit bull that had left the Dog Whisperer's training center just six days before. Alison Bitney was visiting a friend in California in September 2014 when the dog named Gus--which had a documented history of aggressive behavior--savagely bit her left arm, which has left her hand with no feeling or function. Bitney filed suit in California against her friend John Vazzoler, the Dog Psychology Center in Santa Clarita, Millan and a rescuer who'd previously saved the dog from being euthanized following an attack in Katy, Texas in February 2013. Scroll down for video  . Sued: Florida nurse Alison Bitney is suing Cesar Milan after a pit bull (not the one pictured) that was trained at his California Dog Psychology center savagely attacked her in September . According to the suit, the dog inflicted 'disfiguring open wounds, deep muscle and tendon lacerations' on Bitney, who's now seeking punitive damages, reports the LA Times. The dog had previously been sentenced to die by a Texas judge in February 2014 after he attacked a trainer named Amber Rickles. The canine was in her care after its owner surrendered him for being 'nervous, growling and doesn't like children,' according to Bitney's suit. 'With the pit bull still attached to her left breast, Ms. Rickles backed into a laundry room where the dog released his grip, enabling Ms. Rickles to close the door. The pit bull then broke through the door and attacked Ms. Rickles a third time, latching onto her left arm and breaking it in two places,' reads the suit as obtained by Courthouse News. Despite the horrific nature of the attack and the grueling surgeries and rehabilitation the suit says Rickles had to endure, Gus was rescued by the woman who'd originally brought him to Rickles, Jennifer L. Romano. Bitney says Romano appealed to the judge, who allowed Gus to live so long as Milan's Dog Psychology Center then agreed to take the pit bull and rehabilitate it at Millan's center, according to the 27-page lawsuit. The Dog Whisperer, as he's known, did not have contact with the animal in question, his lawyers say. However, Bitney's suit claims his facility released the dog, which had a history of attacking people and other dogs, while knowing it was a danger . 'Thereafter, Cesar Millan and his Dog Psychology Center, agreed to take over custody and control of the pit bull and not to release it until it was \"fully deemed a safe member of society,\"' reads complaint. However, Rickles claims the dog owner fell behind in payments to the center and was 'entrusted it to someone with no training or experience' on September 17, according to the suit. Days later, Bitney was attacked. However, the Dog Psychology Center tells the LA Times that Gus left the facility 'against the strong advice and objection of his trainer.' What's more, Cesar Millan, who is named in the suit, was never in contact with the animal, they say. Bitney is suing for an unknown sum. A call to her attorneys at Scolinos, Sheldon & Nevell was not immediately returned.  .   .", "claim": "艾莉森·比特尼在2014年9月拜访一个朋友时,一只名叫古斯塔沃的比特犬袭击了她的左臂。"}

FIFA executive committee members and associates at the heart of the serial wrongdoing have been staying at the hotel on the banks of Lake Zurich and plotting their dark arts in its salons since 2004.  . It was twice raided by Swiss police in 2015 as part of the US Justice Department’s investigation into criminal FIFA activity. Those arrested face trial in Brooklyn, New York, in December 2017. It was also where in December 2010 some FIFA executive members promised Prince William, David Cameron and David Beckham their support for England’s bid to host the 2018 World Cup, only to renege when they voted. Instead, the newly formed FIFA council will stay at the nearby Park Hyatt ahead of their meeting next week. FIFA say it is a cost-cutting exercise which will save them tens of thousands of pounds each year.  . But continuing to use the Baur au Lac would only act as a constant reminder of FIFA’s rotten regime. A hotel spokesman said: ‘It is our policy not to make any statements in regard to our esteemed guests.’ . CONCACAF, the FIFA confederation covering the Caribbean, North and Central America, are considering changing their name because of the scandal. Football Americas is a possibility. Soccerex founder Duncan Revie, whose funeral is at Mortlake on Friday, kept secret his two-year fight against liver cancer because he didn’t want his illness to impact on anybody else’s life.  . So much so that Duncan’s sad death at the age of 62 was not made public for three days until the end of the latest Soccerex conference last week because he didn’t want his passing to overshadow the occasion. Another lucrative option has opened up for top players at the end of their careers. An ambitious project to stage indoor six-a-side World Cup tournaments will start at the O2 arena next July, with 12 countries competing. Already signed up to play and promote Star Sixes, a joint project between Pitch International and Football Champions Tour, are Steven Gerrard, Deco, Carles Puyol and Robert Pires, with other England ex-stars in talks including Rio Ferdinand, Owen Hargreaves and Sportsmail’s Jamie Carragher. China, who are one of the 12 countries involved, are seen as a major market for the format, with the second competition planned for Beijing. Mel Stein, mainstay of the Association of Football Agents, claimed at the Leaders conference that the FA did not delve into Sam Allardyce’s background in enough detail before making him England manager.  . He said: ‘For sure they didn’t do it (due diligence). It’s obvious they didn’t. If anybody had spoken to us, we would’ve said, “You know what, he’s not Mother Teresa. He’s a very good manager, but there is some kind of a storm brewing’.” . Leagues’ UEFA backlash . The European Professional Football Leagues threatened again at the Leaders summit to allow club fixtures on Champions League nights in breach of their UEFA agreement. This follows EPFL’s upset at not being consulted over the Champions League guaranteeing the big four countries four places each, a move seen by Scottish football chief Neil Doncaster and others as leading to a closed shop.  . EPFL chief Lars-Christer Olsson meets UEFA president Aleksander Ceferin on Thursday but EPFL have little power apart from talking a good game. You would imagine Aston Villa chief executive Keith Wyness would be focused on his club’s plight at the foot of the Championship rather than outlining at the Leaders conference the deluded ambition of a Villa group of clubs around the world similar to Manchester City’s model.

{"label": "CORRECT", "text": "By . James Chapman for the Daily Mail . The validity of next year’s General Election is being called into question if the Scots vote for independence. Currently, voters north of the border are expected to be able to take part next May, meaning Labour could win a majority thanks to its dominance of Scottish constituencies. In May 2010 Labour won 41 seats in Scotland, the Lib Dems 11, the SNP six while the Conservatives secured just one MP. Scroll down for video  . The validity of the 2015 General Election is being called into question because a Labour win means, led by Ed Miliband (pictured) they'd be in charge of a 'zombie government' in power thanks to Scottish MPs . But all Scottish MPs would be swept away in March 2016, when Scotland would become an independent nation.  . One minister said: ‘Labour could win a majority in 2015 but it would be running a zombie government which everyone knows would lose that majority less than a year later. What would happen then? Nobody seems to be thinking about these questions.’ . Some MPs now suggest they will call for legislation to be introduced to postpone the election in the event of a yes vote.  . Former Labour MP Eric Joyce, now an independent, said the election would ‘surely be cancelled’ . It would be the first time since 1940, a year into the second world war, that a general election would have been postponed. Former Labour MP Eric Joyce, now an independent, said the election would ‘surely be cancelled’, adding: ‘An English parliamentary election would be an entirely new proposition for voters south of the new border. ‘There could meanwhile be no question that, for example, Labour might win a UK election by a small majority, only to see a Tory government and prime minister take power in England without an election once the Scots had departed.  . 'Moreover, the notion of Scottish MPs voting on England-only matters while the whole parliament was consumed by Scots extracting themselves from the union would be nonsensical and unmanageable.’ . Angus Robertson, SNP leader at Westminster, called last year for a delay in the election to allow the negotiations on separation to take place.  . But the House of Lords constitution select committee raised doubts about a delay, saying: ‘The extension of a parliament beyond five years ... may risk being seen by voters as self-serving, extending the time in power of the current government.’   .", "claim": "埃德米利班德领导的工党赢得席位意味着他们将掌管一个“僵尸政府”。"}
{"label": "CORRECT", "text": "The search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane will be entering a new phase that will use private contractors and may cost about $60 million, Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott said Monday. \"I regret to say that thus far none of our efforts in the air, on the surface or under sea, have found any wreckage,\" he said. The new phase will focus on searching the ocean floor over a much larger area -- 60,000 square kilometers, a process that will take about six to eight months. \"We do not want this crippling cloud of uncertainty to hang over this family and the wider traveling public,\" he said. It is \"highly unlikely\" that any debris will be found on the ocean surface, Abbott said. By this time, most of the debris will have become waterlogged and will have submerged, he said. As such, authorities will be suspending aerial searches. Words of praise . Malaysia's government has been widely criticized over its handling of the search for missing Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and disclosures of its investigations. But on Sunday, U.S. President Barack Obama had words of praise during a visit to the southeast Asian country. He said the Malaysian government has been \"forthcoming\" with the United States about the information it has. \"The Malaysian government is working tirelessly to recover the aircraft and investigate exactly what happened,\" Obama told reporters. He reiterated that the United States would continue to aid in the search and offered condolences to loved ones of those lost. Narrowed search nears end . Obama's visit came as the initial search by the Bluefin-21 neared its end. The submersible, which is on contract to the U.S. Navy, had been scouring the ocean floor for traces of the plane. Previously, another device, a towed pinger locator, detected signals that officials believed were from the jet's flight recorders, which determined the current search area for the Bluefin. The plane disappeared on March 8 after leaving Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, for Beijing. Preliminary report . Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak  has said a preliminary report on the plane's disappearance will be available to the public next week. He also asked an internal investigation team to look into what other information may be released publicly next week, his office said. The report has been sent to the International Civil Aviation Organization, the U.N. body for global aviation, but not yet made available to the public. The U.N. organization said among the safety recommendations in the report is a suggestion by Malaysia that the aviation world needs to look at real-time tracking of commercial aircraft. It's the same recommendation that was made after Air France Flight 447 went down in the Atlantic Ocean in 2009. \"Anytime there is a tragedy like this, we ought to also reflect on what can be done going forward to prevent something similar from happening again,\" Obama said. \"That discussion has begun in Malaysia and around the world, and we'll see what improvements might be recommended to continue improving aviation security. One thing is already clear, however, is that large international efforts like this search operation benefit from existing partnerships among nations.\" Why didn't emergency beacon work?", "claim": "新阶段将集中在更大的区域搜索海底。"}
