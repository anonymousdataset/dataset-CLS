{"label": "CORRECT", "text": "Tokyo (CNN) -- Nearly 150 former employees of Japan Airlines sued the company Wednesday, demanding their jobs back. The 146 pilots and flight attendants filed suit in Tokyo District Court on the first anniversary of JAL's filing for bankruptcy protection. The airline underwent major restructuring in 2010. Most of the staff reduction came through voluntary retirements, but the airline fired 165 employees at the end of 2010 to achieve targets. The airline cut nearly 30% of its workforce -- more than 16,000 employees -- based on a court-approved restructuring plan. JAL representative Hideo Seto urged people to focus on the positive. \"We would like you to understand the fact that we have protected 36,000 jobs rather than how many people we laid off,\" Seto said. \"We used the public money and eliminated many aircraft. Therefore we need to cut staff who works there. We have no other way than firing the employees.\" The airline's chairman, Kazuo Inamori, said Wednesday JAL had a \"bright outlook.\" \"We all have worked hard to reduce costs and, as you know, we have achieved a financial result far exceeding the rehabilitation plan,\" the 78-year-old chairman said. \"In that sense, we have a bright outlook for JAL's reconstruction,\" he said after a visit to maintenance crews working on a jumbo jet. \"My biggest concern was how the morale of workers was affected by the major restructuring, which was really a tragedy,\" said Inamori. \"Fortunately, they are all in good spirits and working hard for the company's reconstruction.\" Under the drastic restructuring plan based on the Corporate Rehabilitation Law, the former national flag carrier got a debt waiver of 520 billion yen (about $6.3 billion) from banks. It also got a 350 billion yen (about $4.3 billion) cash injection from the quasi-governmental Enterprise Turnaround Initiative Corporation of Japan (ETICJ) in return for delisting its stocks, cutting more than 16,000 employees, 44 aircraft and 51 flight routes in 2010. It achieved a dramatic turnaround in the first 8 months, making 146 billion yen in profit. It is aiming to list its stocks again by the end of 2012. Japan's airline industry expects even tougher competition as low cost airlines are trying to join the market. \"Competing only in low price would be very dangerous as we are not yet strong enough financially and structurally. Rather than becoming such an airline, we would like to aim to remain as a high-quality airline,\" said Inamori. Meanwhile, JAL announced a new logo in a news conference. \"We will depart from the past and create a new JAL,\" airline president Masaru Onishi said, expressing JAL's \"gratitude for the chance given to us a year ago.\" The new logo is a soaring Japanese red-crown crane with its wings extended in full flight. The design was changed a little from the original trademark that went out of use in 2008. \"We decided to employ the logo design using JAL's original trademark crane motif to symbolize our determination returning to the challenging spirit we had at the foundation of this company,\" said Onishi.", "claim": "日本航空公司的近150名前雇员起诉该公司。"}
{"label": "CORRECT", "text": "16:54 EST, 29 May 2013 . Deal: Sgt. Robert Bales' lawyer said that he will be pleading guilty in an effort to avoid the death penalty, which the U.S. Army was seeking in his case after he reportedly killed 16 Afghan villagers in a predawn rampage in March . The Army staff sergeant charged with slaughtering 16 villagers during one of the worst atrocities of the Afghanistan war has agreed to plead guilty in a deal to avoid the death penalty. Staff Sgt. Robert Bales is scheduled to enter guilty pleas to charges of premeditated murder June 5 at Joint Base Lewis-McChord south of Seattle, his lawyer John Henry Browne told The Associated Press on Wednesday. A sentencing-phase trial set for September will determine whether he is sentenced to life in prison with or life without the possibility of parole. The judge and commanding general must approve a plea deal. Browne previously indicated Bales remembered little from the night of the massacre, but he said the soldier will give a full account of what happened before the judge decides whether to accept the plea. In earlier interviews, Bales' lawyer argues that the Army was pushing the possibility of the death penalty. 'The Army is not taking . responsibility for Sgt. Bales and other soldiers that the Army knowingly . sends into combat situations with diagnosed PTSD, concussive head . injuries and other injuries,' Browne said. 'The . Army is trying to take the focus off the failure of its decisions, and . the failure of the war itself, and making Sgt. Bales out to be a rogue . soldier.' Bales, an Ohio native and father of two, slipped away from his remote southern Afghanistan outpost at Camp Belambay early on March 11, 2012, and attacked Afghan compounds in two slumbering villages nearby. Changing tales: Bales' lawyer says the army should take greater responsibility for sending soldiers into combat who are suffering from PTSD and head injuries, but now he seems grateful for the plea deal . Most of the victims were women and children, and some of the bodies were piled and burned. The slayings drew such angry protests that the U.S. temporarily halted combat operations in Afghanistan. Bales was serving his fourth tour in a combat zone, and the allegations against him raised questions about the toll multiple deployments were taking on American troops. For that reason, many legal experts believed it that it was unlikely that he would receive the death penalty, as Army prosecutors were seeking. Adding to that, the military justice system hasn't executed anyone since 1961. The plea deal could inflame tensions in Afghanistan as relatives of the victims in Kandahar became outraged at the notion Bales might escape the death penalty and even vowed revenge. Bodies of Afghan civilians, allegedly shot by US soldier Staff Sergeant Robert Bales, loaded into the back of a van in Alkozai village of Panjwayi district, Kandahar province . 'For this one thing, we would kill 100 American soldiers,' said Mohammed Wazir, who had 11 family members killed that night, including his mother and 2-year-old daughter. 'A prison sentence doesn't mean anything,' said Said Jan, whose wife and three other relatives died. 'I know we have no power now. But I will become stronger, and if he does not hang, I will have my revenge.' Three of Jan's other family members were wounded, including his 7-year-old granddaughter, who was shot in the head. Bales' wife, Kari Bales, said in a . statement Wednesday that she and their children have been enjoying their . weekend visits with Bales at Joint Base Lewis-McChord, and she hopes he . receives an impartial trial. 'I no longer know if a fair trial for Bob is possible, but it very much is my hope, and I will have faith,' she said.", "claim": "罗伯特·贝尔斯中士将于6月5日在西雅图南部的刘易斯联合基地对预谋谋杀指控认罪。"}

Rioler Martinez from Barranquilla, in northern Colombia’s Atlantico Department, tried to fix a problem with the power supply in his house by using a long stick to touch the electricity cables, which connect his home to the town’s energy supply. As he was fumbling around he touched the cables and the electricity coursed through him. In a 23-second-video Mr Martinez can be seen on top of a pole handling the electric cables with his bare hands. Moments after, a huge spark can be seen emanating from the bundle of cables, powerfully hitting Mr Martinez's body. Mr Martinez hung seemingly lifeless on the pole for more than an hour before emergency services got to the scene and brought him down. He was immediately taken to hospital. His incredible brush with death was filmed by Cesar Sarmiento, who said: 'The voltage was strong. I stopped and started crying when I saw it.' . Doctors treating him said they were amazed he survived because usually anything over 11,000 volts is fatal. Doctor Karen Blanco, one of those treating him, said: 'When he got here, he was in a very serious condition.' The man’s survival was inexplicable, medical staff said. Mr Martinez later said: 'At some point I got the electric shock.' 'I don’t remember when. I had a stick on my hand and that touched the electricity supply.

{"label": "INCORRECT", "text": "It's still rolling. The red paint may have been chipped, the bodywork a bit bashed up and the foot has perhaps eased on the accelerator ever so slightly. But the juggernaut keeps moving along. The notion that a home draw with Dundee could possibly be construed as a point gained by the Dons would have seemed faintly absurd before kick-off. Eight straight league wins without conceding tends to offer that kind of all-or-nothing perspective. By the time Ryan Jack bundled home the sixth and final goal of an enthralling match deep into injury time, though, no one was thinking of two points lost - save the sizeable, shell-shocked Dark Blue contingent of course. David Goodwillie (left) celebrates his goal for Aberdeen against Dundee with striker Adam Rooney . Two goals behind with three minutes of regulation time to play, the salvation of the match from the league leaders was every bit as remarkable as the fact they had not bludgeoned Dundee into submission by the time half-an-hour had elapsed. It was a captivating, bizarre afternoon. The kind of day when neither laughing nor crying seemed appropriate for either manager. Once breath had been drawn, Derek McInnes was closer to the former, with Paul Hartley, his opposite number, solemnly scratching around for positives. There were many of those. Dundee were magnificent in patches, most notably in the 10 minutes before half-time when Gary Irvine and Greg Stewart finished excellent team moves to cancel out David Goodwillie’s opener. They were efficient and effective for much of the second period and not ill-deserving of the deflection that took Gary Harkins’ volley beyond Scott Brown to make it 3-1 - only to wilt at the end when their leaden feet became planted in their own box. Dundee's Kevin Thomson (right) tries to evade the challenge of Aberdeen Peter Pawlett . You could only admire Aberdeen’s steadfast refusal to bow down to the seemingly inevitable. Invigorated by the late introductions of Willo Flood, Cammy Smith and, most tellingly, Lawrence Shankland, they strained every sinew to restore parity with two late goals. A crowd of nigh on 17,000 inside Pittodrie bellowed its approval at their favourites’ indefatigability. If this goes down as a bad day at the office by recent standards, then they will take them now and again. It almost goes without saying that, if hopes of the title are to remain alive, they won’t want to be emulating Harry Houdini too often but, occasionally, such acts of escapology are necessary. Shankland, a 19-year-old contemporary of Andrew Robertson from their Queen’s Park days, was the unlikely hero of the hour. Aberdeen's Peter Pawlett (left) battles for the ball with Dundee's Kevin Thomson o Saturday . Thrown from the bench to replace Adam Rooney with seven minutes remaining, he repeatedly displayed that most coveted of striking habits - being in the right place at the right time. Having made sure Kostadin Gadzhalov clipped his ankles to allow Jonny Hayes to score from the spot on 87 minutes, he then teed up Jack with a headed flick in the second of four added-on minutes to win a point that was celebrated as fervently as any last-gasp victory. The Dons may have had their lead at the top over Celtic cut to two points but, as Dundee found to their cost, their grasp of the meaning of the word defeat is becoming increasingly flimsy. ‘We all believed,’ said Shankland. ‘You never give up in a game and there were still a lot of minutes to go. Ten minutes is enough to score two goals, as we showed. We are delighted to get the draw in the end.’ . The expected script was being rigidly adhered to when Goodwillie smashed Rooney’s cross high beyond Scott Bain inside seven minutes, the goal stemming from Niall McGinn picking Irvine’s pocket. Dundee's Greg Stewart runs off in celebration with his arms aloft after he scores against Aberdeen . For the next 20 minutes, the only debate seemed the margin of Aberdeen’s victory. Rooney somehow missed a pinch from three yards after Hayes’ initial shot had been blocked by a defender, Jack’s strike flew a yard wide and Dundee just couldn’t get up for air. Then, remarkably, having not lost a league goal in 757 minutes, the Dons conceded two in 180 seconds. Irvine redeemed himself with a lung-bursting run and a splendid finish to a sweeping six-pass move. Then, before calm could be restored, Stewart marched onto Luka Tankulic’s sumptuous flick and artfully found the bottom corner with the outside of his boot. Had Rooney found the net and not the base of the post two minutes after the restart, the game may have veered in a different direction but, as it was, Harkins’ fearsome volley, which nipped the leg of Ash Taylor, a minute later set the hare racing. If question marks were raised about whether Aberdeen were about to suffer a serious blow to their aspirations, there seemed no doubt about the validity of Alan Muir’s spot-kick award, which Hayes just about squeezed past the Dundee keeper and, from that moment on, the visitors were on the ropes. Dundee's Greg Stewart scores for his side to put them 2-1 up against Aberdeen . Shay Logan’s speculative cross was helped on by Shankland and Jack’s gamble paid off handsomely as he bundled the ball home from a matter of two yards. Every title-winning team enjoys such moments of relief. McInnes stated afterwards that it could be a huge point for his side but was characteristically elusive when pressed on exactly what it could mean in the final reckoning. Improvement - whether week by week or season on season - remains the mantra of those inside Pittodrie. Shankland, the scorer of 19 goals for the development team this season, is certainly growing in stature and is the kind of livewire presence that suggests the depth of McInnes’ squad is very much in keeping with that of a genuine title contender. ‘We looked out of it at the end, but I managed to get two assists,’ beamed the 19-year-old Glaswegian. ‘The manager sent me on and told me to do what I could. He said: “You have got your minutes on the pitch, so go and do what you can.” . ‘The gaffer wants me to score goals and that is my job as a striker. I have not managed to score, but I got the assists, so I am happy. ‘I am confident. I try to get myself into good positions on the pitch and, hopefully, I can put one in.’ . Not quite confident enough yet to spot the ball for the penalty he won, however. ‘No, there are a few experienced boys and I left it to them,’ smiled Shankland. ‘Jonny took it well, to be fair.’ . Despite the formidable figures of Goodwillie and Rooney standing ahead of him in the queue for a starting berth, in Jack - again invaluable to the Dons’ cause here - Shankland sees a road map to regular involvement. ‘We have a really strong squad and the strikers have been doing really well and scoring goals,’ he said. ‘They have created a lot for the team and so I had to be patient, work hard in training and, when I get my chance, I know I have to have as much impact on the game as I can. ‘Jacko is a good player and we have a lot of them at the club. They have taken their chance when it has come along and that is what I need to do to get myself into the team.’ . And so to McDiarmid Park on Friday. Shorn of Taylor for around a month after the defender hobbled off with a knee complaint around the hour mark, McInnes will have to move his pieces around the board and re-strategise. But they are still in the game.", "claim": "阿伯丁周六在苏格兰足球超级联赛以2比1击败邓迪。"}
