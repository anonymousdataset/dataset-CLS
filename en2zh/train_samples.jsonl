{"text": "los angeles (cnn) -- federal authorities on friday arrested a man on a weapons charge as he was being released from a los angeles county jail a day after he pleaded guilty in the 2011 brutal beating of a giants fan at dodgers stadium and received credit for time served. agents from the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, firearms and explosives took marvin norwood, 33, into custody friday morning on a federal weapons charge as the los angeles county sheriff released him. norwood was sentenced thursday to four years in prison immediately after pleading guilty to felony assault by means likely to produce great bodily injury. he was released friday with credit for having been held in jail in the case for more than two years. a co-defendant, louie sanchez, 31, also pleaded guilty thursday to felony mayhem and was sentenced to eight years in prison. in exchange for the guilty pleas, prosecutors dropped other felony charges. prosecutors say the two men attacked bryan stow in the dodgers' stadium parking lot after the opening day game on march 31, 2011, when the team played the san francisco giants. stow is a giants fan. stow, a paramedic from santa cruz, california, went into a coma as a result of the beating and, after returning to consciousness, is still struggling with a severe brain injury. stow, now 45, is disabled and unable to care for himself, his father, david, told the court thursday. stow is also a father of two. norwood faces a charge of being a felon in possession of firearms, and the charge relates to firearms that authorities allegedly found in norwood's home in rialto, california, during their investigation into stow's beating, according to a spokesman for the u.s. attorney's office in los angeles and to an fbi affidavit. sanchez also faces the same federal charge, said thom mrozek, spokesman for federal prosecutors in los angeles.", "entailment": "2011年，他在道奇体育场残忍殴打了一名巨人队球迷，对此他。", "contradiction": "周四，他在道奇体育场残忍殴打了一名巨人队球迷，对此他认罪。"}
{"text": "jill dillard is back in arkansas and reuniting with her family after spending close to a year in central america doing mission work with husband derrick and son israel. and while she is no doubt thrilled to be reunited with her 18 siblings, jill and the rest of her brood are also probably exhausted following a very long travel day which she and derrick documented on their social media accounts. in one photo posted to twitter on thursday, jill can be seen standing by israel as he tries to climb up a small slide in an airport play area, blocking the path of the little girl trying to get down. derrick managed to find the humor in the scene, writing: 'trying to teach this guy to be a gentleman today here at the airport. #toddlerentertainment #layovers #dfwairport.' jill also posted an airport photo thursday which showed her husband and their son as they played with some plastic cups. that photo also introduced the newest member of the dillard family - derrick's man bun. 'travel days can be long but we look forward to being home with family & friends soon! #papiandisrael #playingwithcups #dfwairport #lovethekidsarea,' wrote jill on her instagram photo, which made no mention of her husband's new look. the dillards first shared the news that they would be returning to the united states last month, making it clear however that it would only be for a few months. in the month since they revealed their plans, many have begun to wonder if jill might have planned the trip because she is, or is hoping to be, pregnant. central america has been one of the regions of the world hardest hit by the current zika outbreak, with cases having been reported now in every country. jill does not appear to be pregnant at this time in any photos posted of her on social media and has not addressed the rumors. it would certainly not be a surprise if jill was already planning for baby number two though, with her mother michelle never going more than two years without giving birth between 1988 when son josh was born and 2009 when she delivered daughter josie. the duggar family's penchant for procreation was a frequent topic of discussion on their former tlc show, the aptly titled 19 kids and counting. jill and her sister jessa both have one child, while josh and his wife anna have four children. the timing of jill's return also makes sense given the fact that the family's reality show counting on will premiere at the end of august. tlc made the decision to drop jill and her sister jessa's names from the title of the show this season so it is unclear how big their roles will be , but there is little doubt that the network would like to have the two girls available to do press. also likely to be out and about doing press this time around will be jinger duggar and her new fiance jeremy vuolo. jill's return to arkansas will be the first time she is seeing the pair since they shared their engagement news last month. there had been reports that josh duggar would be joining the new season of counting on, which would mark his return to reality television in the wake of his molestation, pornography and affair scandals, which all came to light over the course of just four months last year. the network has offered no official comment but multiple sources close to the family and show have been quick to shoot that rumor down. most of the uproar over the actions of child molester josh - who prior to his summer of disgrace worked for the family research council - has died down over the past year. he spent months hidden away at a faith-based rehab facility in illinois over that time, flying out in september shortly after it was revealed that he had been using an ashley madison account. his account on that site, which caters to people looking to have extra-marital affairs, is back in the news once again however thanks to a lawsuit that has been filed against him by matthew mccarthy. tmz reports that mccarthy is taking action against josh for using photos of him for his profile pictures on sites like ashley madison and ok cupid. he is suing josh, who is believed to be employed at his family's used car dealership these days, for wrongful use of his image and for damages.", "entailment": "这对夫妇周四在他们的社交媒体账户上发布了照片，记录了他们返回美国的漫长旅程。", "contradiction": "这对夫妇周四在他们的社交媒体账户上发布了照片，记录了他们返回家庭研究委员会的漫长旅程。"}
{"text": "a teenage boy from columbus, georgia, will have his right leg amputated today after a teacher allegedly body-slammed him to the floor three times, causing nerve damage. montravious thomas, 13, was attending edgewood student services center on september 12 when bryant mosley 'had to physically restrain a student. due to behavioral issues,' a columbus police department report said. but an attorney representing thomas and his mother says mosley repeatedly threw the boy to the ground then sent him home without medical attention or telling his mom, the ledger-enquirer reported. thomas was attending the aim program, which hosts children who have been temporarily removed from their regular schools due to disruptive behavior, when the incident happened. it was his first day at the program, according to wtvm. according to renee tucker, who represents thomas and his mom lawanda, the boy was trying to leave class to call his mom when mosley, a behavioral specialist, stopped him. mosley then threw him to the floor for an 'unknown reason,' tucker said, and did it again when the boy tried to leave again. video courtesy of wtvm.com . tucker also claims that eddie powell, the assistant principal, saw the violence at one point, an that a school resource officer saw thomas limping away but didn't help or file a report. the attorney also says that the school talked about calling for an ambulance, but then decided against it, and that mosley then put the boy on a bus home without calling his family. 'we don’t know the extent that the injuries were worsened by the failure to render aid and certainly by picking him up and seating him on the school bus,' tucker told the leger-enquirer . 'then they had him ride in that same school bus home without any support or stabilization of that leg.' the boy's mom took him to a columbus hospital when he got home. he was then airlifted to an atlanta hospital. since then, he has undergone four surgeries alloncolumbus reported. lawanda thomas spent as much time with her son as she could - to the point that she lost her job. but on sunday the 13-year-old was told that the nerve damage was so severe, his leg would have to be amputated. 'my client is certainly aware of the situation and naturally he’s emotional,' ticker told alloncolumbus. 'doctors talked to him and his mother on sunday and told him they were having to take his leg since they were unable to improve the flow of blood to his lower leg. 'right now we are all concerned for his long-term health.' the family will be pursuing a lawsuit, tucker said, and that early filing notices put the figure at $5million. a police report filed at the time cited 'behavioral issues' as the reason for mosley having to 'physically restrain' the boy, according to wtvm. and in a statement to the press, muscogee county school district director of communications valerie fuller cited safety issues for the altercation. 'it is our understanding that there were issues concerning the safety of the child and others in the room, which called for the use of restraint per state guidance,' she said. she added that 'physical restraint' is allowed in georgia schools if 'the student is an immediate danger to himself or others and (they are) not responsive to less intensive behavioral interventions including verbal directives or other de-escalation techniques.' there were no other children in the room at the time, tucker said. the attorney also says that an insider has told her there is video footage of the alleged assault and has filed an open records request to see it. fuller also appeared to distance the district from mosley, saying that he was not hired directly by them. 'bryant mosley was provided by mentoring and behavioral services, a contract service provider, to the muscogee county school district,' she said in her statement. 'mr mosley is not presently providing services to the muscogee county school district. 'mr mosley is specifically trained in mindset curriculum, a system of preventing and managing aggressive behavior, and georgia restraint requirements.' . the teacher is no longer working at the school, fuller said, although it isn't known when that decision was made. mentoring and behavioral services' (mbs) website says that it provides autism, aspergers, adhd, and behavioral services in columbus and phenix city. the site says it is a 'client focused organization that specializes in individualizing holistic behavioral approaches to produce a healthy and productive environment that fosters positive growth.' . it says that it follows the 'wholesome values' including compassion, caring, honesty and integrity. it is currently 'accepting clients between the ages of 2-18 that have been diagnosed on the autism spectrum.' . when asked whether bryant was still employed by mbs, dailymail.com was directed to the company's rob poydasheff, who declined to comment. 'at this point, we are still in the early stages of investigating the events which occurred and i have advised my client not to comment or speculate on the matter until we have completed our investigation,' he wrote. 'we are certainly very concerned for montravious and our hearts go out to him. he and his family are in our thoughts as prayers.' bryant has not been charged with any crimes related to the incident, according to wtvm.", "entailment": "莫斯利是学校的合同工，现在已经不在了。", "contradiction": "富勒是学校的合同工，现在已经不在那里了。"}
